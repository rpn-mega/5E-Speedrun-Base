Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sneak Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.</p>\n\n<p><b>Thieves’ Cant</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cunning Action</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Roguish Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Uncanny Dodge</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as an ancient red dragon’s fiery breath or an <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">ice storm</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reliable Talent</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blindsense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} creature within 10 feet of you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slippery Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.</p>\n\n<p><b>Elusive</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stroke of Luck</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a rapier or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a shortbow and quiver of 20 arrows or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a shortsword</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a burglar’s pack, (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack, or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">c</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Leather armor, two daggers, and thieves’ tools</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 94, Basic Rules pg 97","identifier":"rogue","levels":10,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"kr5kvzoadiob9ruc","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"js0n1dqrrdhzuep8","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"distance":{"units":""},"identifier":"sneak-attack","type":"dice","scale":{"1":{"n":1,"die":6},"3":{"n":2,"die":6},"5":{"n":3,"die":6},"7":{"n":4,"die":6},"9":{"n":5,"die":6},"11":{"n":6,"die":6},"13":{"n":7,"die":6},"15":{"n":8,"die":6},"17":{"n":9,"die":6},"19":{"n":10,"die":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Sneak Attack","icon":""}],"saves":["dex","int"],"skills":{"number":4,"choices":["acr","ath","dec","ins","itm","inv","prc","prf","per","slt","ste"],"value":["ste","ath","acr","ins"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Bma2Tjo69rWm2oPf":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":110540370,"definitionId":12,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"importId":"937tjo0l5mn822id"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Rogue"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"7f54f1ae7b533d86521d2259736c5dc6ff0f0666"}}},{"_id":"wOmVsdfVIIyZVefE","name":"Human","type":"feat","img":"https://www.dndbeyond.com/avatars/9/386/636327460764467148.jpeg?width=1000&height=1000&fit=bounds&quality=95&auto=webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races.

See <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Rules</span></a> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <a style=\"color:#704cd9\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=1&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Spells Listing</span></a> for the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Cantrips</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spell Slots</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{performance} of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell save DC </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b><span style=\"font-weight:400\">= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</span></p>\n<h5><b>Ritual Casting</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</span></p>\n<h5><b>Spellcasting Focus</b></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use a musical instrument (see the <a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Tools\"><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Tools</span></a> section) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bardic Inspiration</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Jack of All Trades</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Song of Rest</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{performance} regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Bard College</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore detailed at the end of the class description or another from the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Player's Handbook</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:400\"> or other sources.

Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Prone]{prone}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Wholeness of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tranquility</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">sanctuary</span> spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.</p>\n\n<p><b>Quivering Palm</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"way-of-the-open-hand","classIdentifier":"monk","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Bma2Tjo69rWm2oPf":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":110537830,"id":17,"importId":"trb7sktacah5qni8"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Way of the Open Hand"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"f73a52cf81f0a27f215ea74bdd2e9bc8fc756cbd"}}},{"_id":"PlRZ60DNDVTlFZ4h","name":"Monk","type":"class","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_35.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d8<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Dexterity &amp; Wisdom<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Strength &amp; Dexterity</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice:</span></strong> 1d8 per monk level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level:</span></strong> 8 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels:</span></strong> 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per monk level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Simple weapons, shortswords<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>Choose one type of artisan’s tools or one musical instrument<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Strength, Dexterity<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills:</span></strong> Choose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Acrobatics}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Athletics}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Religion}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Stealth}</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.</p>\n\n<p><b>Martial Arts</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of combat styles that use unarmed strikes and monk weapons, which are shortswords and any simple melee weapons that don’t have the two-handed or heavy property.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon in the <a title=\"Weapons\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#Weapons\">Weapons</a> section.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start knowing three such features: <strong>Flurry of Blows</strong>, <strong>Patient Defense</strong>, and <strong>Step of the Wind</strong>. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this class.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating to regain your ki points.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Ki save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flurry of Blows</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Patient Defense</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Step of the Wind</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Monastic Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition: the Way of the Open Hand, detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Deflect Missiles</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier + your monk level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Slow Fall</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your monk level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stunning Strike</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Stunned]{stunned} until the end of your next turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ki-Empowered Strikes</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Evasion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">fireball</span> spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Stillness of Mind</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Movement Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and across liquids on your turn without falling during your move.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you immune to disease and poison.</p>\n\n<p><b>Tongue of the Sun and Moon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language can understand what you say.</p>\n\n<p><b>Diamond Soul</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in all saving throws.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however.

You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pact Boon</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Metadata\">At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service.

It ends early if you are knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious} or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Unarmored Defense</b></p>\n<p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Reckless Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Danger Sense</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Blinded]{blinded}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Deafened]{deafened}, or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Primal Path</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} of your rage. The Path of the Berserker is detailed at the end of the class description, and additional primal paths are available in other sources. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Fast Movement</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Instinct</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Incapacitated]{incapacitated}, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Brutal Critical</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional dice at 17th level.</span></p>\n\n<p><b>Relentless Rage</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:400\">Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5.

When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level.

When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.</p>\n\n<p><b>Empowered Evocation</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>\n\n<p><b>Overchannel</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores resistance and immunity.</p>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","identifier":"school-of-evocation","classIdentifier":"wizard","advancement":[],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Bma2Tjo69rWm2oPf":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"subclassDefinitionId":110543127,"id":26,"importId":"kjwsqoswrtbysxg9"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"School of Evocation"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"cf19d307773925ed76328ee4ffc8b68a1bdf52f9"}}},{"_id":"eX3ujk1MmbdDaHLQ","name":"Wizard","type":"class","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/skills/blue_13.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<h1>Description</h1><p>A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality</p>\n<p class=\"characters-statblock\" style=\"font-family:Roboto Condensed;font-size:14px\"><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d6<br /><strong>Primary Ability:</strong> Intelligence<br /><strong>Saves:</strong> Intelligence &amp; Wisdom</p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Hit Points</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Dice: </span></strong>1d6 per wizard level<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at 1st Level: </span></strong>6 + your Constitution modifier<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Hit Points at Higher Levels: </span></strong>1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per wizard level after 1st</p>\n\n<p><b>Proficiencies</b></p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Armor:</span></strong> None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Weapons: </span></strong>Daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Tools: </span></strong>None<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Saving Throws: </span></strong>Intelligence, Wisdom<br /><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Bold-Serif\">Skills: </span></strong>Choose two from @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Arcana}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{History}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Insight}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Investigation}, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Medicine}, and @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Religion}</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Wizard)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=8&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the wizard spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellbook</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">magic missile,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Heading\"><strong>YOUR SPELLBOOK</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Copying a Spell into the Book.</span></strong> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">Replacing the Book.</span></strong> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\">If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p class=\"Sidebar-Styles_Sidebar-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Inline-Subhead-Sans-Serif\">The Book’s Appearance.</span></strong> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Recovery</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Arcane Tradition</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation. The School of Evocation is detailed at the end of the class description, and more choices are available in other sources.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spell Mastery</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.</p>\n\n<p><b>Signature Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a quarterstaff or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) a dagger</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a component pouch or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an arcane focus</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a scholar’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A spellbook</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 112, Basic Rules pg 117","identifier":"wizard","levels":10,"hitDice":"d6","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"5mi76s2lj13eosfj","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","his","ins","inv","med","rel"],"value":["ins","inv"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"int"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Bma2Tjo69rWm2oPf":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":110543127,"definitionId":8,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":1,"spellCastingAbility":"int","importId":"kjwsqoswrtbysxg9"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Wizard"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"91ae84b29722c593d48042e0af561d78fa2028ff"}}},{"_id":"CSYNZYh9XlHpST4H","name":"Spellcasting","type":"feat","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/beam-orange-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s myst<span class=\"No-Break\">erious rites.</span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Cantrip</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of druid cantrips you know.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Recovery</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.</p>\n\n<p><b>Circle Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land — arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark — and consult the associated list of spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Arctic</h5>\n<table

You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious}, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Darkvision]{darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Druid Circle</b></p>\n<p>At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle of the Land detailed at the end of the class description or one from the Player's Handbook or other sources. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Wild Shape Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 4th level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before of challenge rating 1/2 or lower that doesn't have a flying speed.

As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p>Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeless Body</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly.

If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds, </span>you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.

You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.MOk1rkF0DeJlcC4l]{unconscious}.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">call lightning</span>, that you’ve already cast.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.10RNSKCH2hTja3DG]{darkvision}, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted-Last\">You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>\n</ul>\n  <p></p>\n</details>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"action","cost":1,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":5,"long":"","units":"ft"},"uses":{"value":2,"max":2,"per":"sr"},"consume":{"type":"attribute","target":"resources.primary.value","amount":1},"ability":"","actionType":"other","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[["@scale.druid.wild-shape",null]],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Bma2Tjo69rWm2oPf":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":"1019","entityTypeId":"222216831","componentId":167,"componentTypeId":12168134,"class":"Druid","subclass":"Circle of the Land","dndbeyond":{"levelScale":{"id":12415,"level":8,"description":"[8th] Max CR 1","dice":null,"fixedValue":null},"levelScales":[{"id":12414,"level":4,"description":"[4th] Max CR 1/2 (no flying speed)","dice":{"diceCount":null,"diceValue":null,"diceMultiplier":null,"fixedValue":null,"diceString":null},"fixedValue":null},{"id":12415,"level":8,"description":"[8th] Max CR 1","dice":{"diceCount":null,"diceValue":null,"diceMultiplier":null,"fixedValue":null,"diceString":null},"fixedValue":null}],"limitedUse":[{"level":null,"uses":1}]},"importId":"0mcz0p9rxnn3b35m"},"infusions":{"infused":false},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Druid"}},"link-item-resource-5e":{"resource-link":"primary"},"scene-packer":{"hash":"26dfb678d6606547180401947d8746c0f475a262"}}},{"_id":"UiSkIlyURJayHAmn","name":"Natural Recovery","type":"feat","img":"systems/dnd5e/icons/spells/vines-jade-3.jpg","data":{"description":{"value":"Once per long rest during a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover.

Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have advantage on Wisdom (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Survival}) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>\n\n<p><b>Natural Explorer</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions.

Choose one of the following options. </p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature} to cast spells, much as a druid does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Ranger)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=5&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the ranger spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spell Slots</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">animal friendship</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{nature}. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n\n<p><b>Ranger Archetype</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: the Hunter that is detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Primeval Awareness</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Land’s Stride</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">entangle</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Hide in Plain Sight</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Stealth}) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vanish</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p><b>Feral Senses</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You are also aware of the location of any @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Invisible]{invisible} creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Blinded]{blinded} or @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Deafened]{deafened}.</p>\n\n<p><b>Foe Slayer</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.</p>\n\n<h1>Starting Equipment</h1>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) scale mail or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) leather armor</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) two shortswords or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) two simple melee weapons</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">(<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">a</span>) a dungeoneer’s pack or (<span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">b</span>) an explorer’s pack</li>\n<li class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Bulleted\">A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows</li>\n</ul>\n\n","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Basic Rules pg 89, Basic Rules pg 93","identifier":"ranger","levels":10,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"rk5sv0zfc5hapnqq","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":["ath","prc","ste"]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Bma2Tjo69rWm2oPf":3},"flags":{"ddbimporter":{"id":110539160,"definitionId":5,"entityTypeId":1446578651,"spellSlotDivisor":2,"spellCastingAbility":"wis","importId":"7kedpwdy2cfjrd19"},"obsidian":{"source":{"type":"class","text":"Ranger"}},"scene-packer":{"hash":"f52aba6b3e9f83858a1dbd85337717c17a49be26"}}},{"_id":"q3lNonFB2nSD2tsu","name":"Natural Explorer: Arctic","type":"feat","img":"icons/tools/navigation/map-simple-tree.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p class=\"compendium-hr\">You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions.

the fundamental forces of the universe — that sustains all life. The gods of life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded, caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and undeath. Almost any non-evil deity can claim influence over this domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-Horakhty), gods of healing or endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, <span class=\"No-Break\">and Boldrei).</span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Bonus Proficiency</b></p>\n<p>When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.</p>\n\n<p><b>Disciple of Life</b></p>\n<p>Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity: Preserve Life</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.</p>\n<p>As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.</p>\n\n<p><b>Blessed Healer</b></p>\n<p>Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Strike</b></p>\n<p>At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Supreme Healing</b></p>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Cleric)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=2&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the cleric spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Cantrips</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.</p>\n<h5 id=\"PreparingandCastingSpells\" class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cleric spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered ParaOverride-2\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Ritual Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your cleric spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Domain</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Using Each Ability]{Nature}, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Life domain is detailed at the end of the class description and provides examples of gods associated with it. See the <i>Player’s Handbook</i> for details on all the domains.Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Domain Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each domain has a list of spells — its domain spells — that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.</p>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as noted in the domain description.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity: Turn Undead</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you.

To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list.

The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds</span>, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells.

To cast one of these sorcerer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">burning hands</span> using either slot.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use an arcane focus (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Adventuring Gear\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#ArcaneFocus\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sorcerous Origin</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Draconic Bloodline, detailed at the end of the class description, or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.</p>\n\n<p><b>Font of Magic</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Sorcery Points</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Flexible Casting</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.

binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or c<span class=\"No-Break\">oats of arms.</span></p><h1>Class Features</h1>\n\n<p><b>Channel Divinity</b></p>\n<p class=\"Basic-Paragraph\">When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Sacred Weapon. </span></strong>As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Unconscious]{unconscious}, this effect ends.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\"><strong><span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Inline-Subhead-Serif\">Turn the Unholy.</span></strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>\n\n<p><b>Oath Spells</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.</p>\n<h5 class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Title\">Oath of Devotion Spells</h5>\n<div class=\"table-overflow-wrapper\">\n<table class=\"compendium-left-aligned-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-3\">\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header\">Paladin Level</th>\n<th class=\"Table Table-Header _idGenCellOverride-1\">Spells</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">3rd</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body _idGenCellOverride-2\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">protection from evil and good</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">sanctuary</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">5th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">lesser restoration</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">zone of truth</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">9th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">beacon of hope</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">dispel magic</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-5\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">13th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">freedom of movement</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">guardian of faith</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"Table _idGenTableRowColumn-4\">\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style- ParaOverride-3\">17th</p>\n</td>\n<td class=\"Table Table-Body\">\n<p class=\"Table-Styles_Table-Body--for-Table-Cell-Style-\" style=\"text-align:left\"><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">commune</span>, <span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Italic-Sans-Serif\">flame strike</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Devotion</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Charmed]{charmed} while you are conscious.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Purity of Spirit</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">protection from evil and good</span> spell.</p>\n\n<p><b>Holy Nimbus</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight.

As an action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance).

You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level × 5.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Fighting Style</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>\n\n<p><b>Spellcasting</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does. See <span style=\"color:#99cc00\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" title=\"Spells Rules\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/spellcasting\">Spells Rules</a></span> for the general rules of spellcasting and the <span style=\"color:#993366\"><a style=\"color:#704cd9\" title=\"Spells Listing (Paladin)\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells?filter-class=4&amp;filter-search=&amp;filter-sub-class=&amp;filter-concentration=&amp;filter-ritual=&amp;filter-unlocked-content=\">Spells Listing</a></span> for the paladin spell list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your paladin spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell <span class=\"Serif-Character-Style_Italic-Serif\">cure wounds,</span> you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Ability</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body-Last--to-apply-extra-space-\">Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell save DC </span></strong>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<p class=\"List-Styles_List-Item-Centered\"><strong><span class=\"Sans-Serif-Character-Styles_Bold-Sans-Serif\">Spell attack modifier </span></strong>= your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>\n<h5 class=\"compendium-hr\">Spellcasting Focus</h5>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use a holy symbol (see the <span style=\"color:#47d18c\"><a style=\"color:#47d18c\" href=\"https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/equipment#HolySymbol\">Adventuring Gear</a></span> section) as a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p>\n\n<p><b>Divine Health</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to disease.</p>\n\n<p><b>Sacred Oath</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion detailed at the end of the class description or one from another source.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Oath Spells</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p>\n<h4 class=\"compendium-hr\">Channel Divinity</h4>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.</p>\n\n<p><b>Ability Score Improvement</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.</p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.</p>\n\n<p><b>Extra Attack</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Protection</b></p>\n<p class=\"compendium-hr\">Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Aura of Courage</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.Frightened]{frightened} while you are conscious.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Improved Divine Smite</b></p>\n<p>By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage.</p>\n\n<p><b>Cleansing Touch</b></p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.</p>\n<p class=\"Core-Styles_Core-Body\">You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
