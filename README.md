5E-Speedrun-Core

5e Speedrun Core Data for Foundry VTT This module contains the core data needed to run 5e Speedruns on Foundry VTT. 5e Speedruns is inspired by the work done by FoxHound (a.k.a Brendan McLeod) and others for use in their Twitch and Youtube Speedrun series. Drawing upon this base, I have modified and enhanced many features of the system in an effort to streamline it for VTT play. This module includes 100 Options for races and 12 different classes which result in a possible 1200 randomly generated characters. Of the 100 races are several "Novelty" races such as Horse, Zombie, or Cowboy.

I have also added rollable tables for: 
Character creation
The Loot Deck
The Deck of Many Things
Wild Magic Surges
Demon Lords Influence
Artifacts
Flaws
Useless Items

All of this content and the associated images from the 5e SRD are included in the module to allow you to use them straight from the compendium.

To generate a character, have the player roll on the class and Race tables, and import the associated Class Template and drag over the content from the Racial Features of the race that was selected to the template. Add a name and a portrait and off you go.
